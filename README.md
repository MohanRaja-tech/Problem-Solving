Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This collection features solutions to a wide range of algorithmic problems from LeetCode. The focus is on writing clean, efficient code across Python and Java programming languages.

This repository showcases my journey in solving algorithmic problems using the Python programming language. Here, you'll find a variety of problems tackled with both brute-force and optimized approaches.

About 💡
In this repository, I focus on demonstrating the evolution of problem-solving strategies. Each algorithm is presented in two parts:

Brute-force Solutions: These implementations are straightforward and easy to understand, laying the groundwork for more complex approaches.

Optimized Solutions: These refined implementations aim to enhance efficiency, reducing time and space complexity while maintaining correctness.

Overview 📝
This repository covers problems from different categories, including:

Arrays
Strings
Math
Sorting
Dynamic Programming
And more...
Languages & Tools ⚙️
The solutions are written in:

Python 🐍: For its simplicity and ease of use in algorithmic challenges.



Java ☕: Emphasizing object-oriented programming and type-safety.

How to Use 🚀
