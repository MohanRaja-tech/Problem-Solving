Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This collection features solutions to a wide range of algorithmic problems from LeetCode. The focus is on writing clean, efficient code across Python and Java programming languages.

This repository showcases my journey in solving algorithmic problems using the Python programming language. Here, you'll find a variety of problems tackled with both brute-force and optimized approaches.

About üí°
In this repository, I focus on demonstrating the evolution of problem-solving strategies. Each algorithm is presented in two parts:

Brute-force Solutions: These implementations are straightforward and easy to understand, laying the groundwork for more complex approaches.

Optimized Solutions: These refined implementations aim to enhance efficiency, reducing time and space complexity while maintaining correctness.

Overview üìù
This repository covers problems from different categories, including:

Arrays
Strings
Math
Sorting
Dynamic Programming
And more...
Languages & Tools ‚öôÔ∏è
The solutions are written in:

Python üêç: For its simplicity and ease of use in algorithmic challenges.



Java ‚òï: Emphasizing object-oriented programming and type-safety.

How to Use üöÄ
Feel free to explore the solutions by cloning this repository and running the scripts in your preferred language environment. The repository is continually updated with new solutions and enhancements to existing ones.



Contributing ü§ù
Contributions are highly welcome! Whether it‚Äôs optimizing an existing solution, suggesting a new approach, or adding solutions to new problems, feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request.


Stay Updated üîÑ
New problems and solutions will be added regularly as I continue to practice and refine my problem-solving skills. Stay tuned for updates and improvements to existing solutions.
